                        The objective of the game is to pairs in the same icon.
                        You will flip over two icons, one icon at a time. If the icons are not the same, 
                        they are flipped back over. If the icons flipped are the same, the pair is kept.
                        Continue until all the icons have been paired.
                        It is essential to pay attention and flex your brain muscles and remember where cards are located. Have fun!

            <h3>What is World Alzheimer's Month?</h3>
            <p>World Alzheimer's Month is a global opportunity to raise awareness around, educate, encourage support of and demystify dementia.</p>
            
            <h3>World Alzheimer's Day?</h3>
            <p>
                World Alzheimer's day is an international campaign to raise awareness and highlight issues faced by people affected by dementia. 
                World Alzheimer's Day takes place every September. 
                Globally, dementia is one of the biggest challenges we face, with nearly 50 million people living with dementia worldwide. 
                To tackle this global dementia challenge we need to work together, and to collaborate and share best practice with one another.
                This is why Alzheimer's Society has committed to work with partners on global research and campaigning.

            <h3>About Dementia</h3>

            <p>Dementia describes a group of symptoms that include problems with memory, thinking or language, and changes in mood, emotions, perception and behaviour.  
            Dementia is a progressive disease, which means symptoms may be relatively mild at first, but they get worse over time. There are many types of dementia but Alzheimerâ€™s disease is the most common. The next most common is vascular dementia. 
       
            <h3>What causes Dementia?</h3>
            <p>Dementia is not a natural part of aging. It is caused when a disease damages nerve cells in the brain.
            Nerve cells carry messages between different parts of the brain, and to other parts of the body. As more nerve cells are damaged, the brain becomes less able to work properly. 
            Dementia can be caused by many different diseases. These diseases affect the brain in different ways, resulting in different types of dementia.
            </p>
            <h3>Short-term Memory</h3>
            <p>
                Short-term memory loss is when you forget things you heard, saw, or did recently. 
                It's a normal part of getting older for many people. 
                But it can also be a sign of a deeper problem, such as dementia, a brain injury, or a mental health issue.
                Playing memory games can improve other brain functions, such as attention, concentration, and focus. 
                Memory games give space to critical thinking and that helps children nurture their attention to detail. 
                Memory games can improve visual recognition.
