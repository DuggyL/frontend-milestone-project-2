## Colour
The reason I chosen these 2 combinations colour for my project is that it synergise very well with the brain mascot(logo/icon).
- The two main primary colours used are Pale Violet Red (Pink) and Medium Slate Blue (Violet Purple).
- Black text for readability on white background.

According to the psychology of colour, pink is a sign of hope. It is a positive colour that inspires warm and comforting feelings. Pink calms and soothes our emotional energies, relieving feelings of anger, aggression, resentment, abandonment and neglect. And the color purple means wisdom, bravery, and spirituality. 

## Typography
<img src=assets/images/screenshots/fredoka-font.png>

I used <b>Fredoka</b> throughout the webpage to maintain cohesion across the project. Using different font weights to convey emphasis and importance on some of the content. The reason I chosen to Fredoka family on this project, it because the font conveys a sense of fun, friendliness and is easy on the eyes. The big, round and bold typeface are clear and has great letter-spacing leading to ease of communication.
